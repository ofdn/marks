# Guidelines
General guidelines for using the O Foundation logos for digital or other use:
* Download the latest version of the logos from this repository
* We recommend .svg for vector use .png versions for rasterized use while using in digital display. Similarly, PDF versions are created for CMYK printing. You will always see the purpose of a particular logo in the logo file e.g. OFDN-logo-color-print.pdf.
* Old and archived logos always have "(archived)" in the filename
* We always recommend to use the logos by keeping the proportions constant (more)
* Most logos in this repository have a transparent background. This helps you to use them in any background of your choice. However, choose the background carefully. Our color logos have blue and grey colors which might not be visible clearly when similar colors are used in the background. In such cases, black and white versions of the logos can be used or white/black rectangles can be used as a background of color logos. More examples of the logo use are explained below.
